# PyBer_Analysis

Overview
The goal of the analysis was to create a summary Dataframe and line chart that show the weekly fares of different city types.  The city types were urban, suburban, and rural.  The data in the dataframe looked at the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver.  The line chart graphed the total fare by city.        

Results
Based on the results we can see that Urban areas have more total rides and drivers.  However, the rides are shorter in distance, as the average fare per ride and fare per driver is less than both Rural and Suburban areas.  The areas that are not urbanized have a higher average fare per ride and fare per driver can be explained by lack of accessibility.  The less drivers can lead to higher average fares.  The lack of drivers in these areas causes the price to increase when driver availability is low.  In the total fare by city line chart, we can see that there is a increase in all 3 areas at the end of February.  The rest of the chart fluctuates throughout March and April.  The suburban areas see a sharp increase in April.

Summary
A business recommendation I would recommend is that the rideshare company should determine the reason why there is an increase in rides in the suburban areas. There looks like an opportunity for more drivers in that area.  
The company can also use this information to possibly add more drivers in rural and suburban areas.  Increasing drivers in these areas could lead to more profit because the average fare is more.  Riders in those areas may travel farther, but if there were more drivers there may be more of an opportunity for drivers to make more per ride.  Conversely, you can limit drivers in those areas if there are more than needed.  This would help with profit goals the company wants to achieve for its drivers.  
Lastly the company can influence where they want their drivers based on the time of year.  We can see that the fares increase in all the areas in late February.  They can make sure they hire and have enough drivers during this time period.
